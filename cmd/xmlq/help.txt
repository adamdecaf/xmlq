XMLQ(1)                         User Commands                        XMLQ(1)

NAME
       xmlq - pretty-print XML documents (with optional masking)

SYNOPSIS
       xmlq [OPTIONS] [FILE]...

       xmlq < input.xml

DESCRIPTION
       xmlq reads XML from files or standard input and outputs a nicely
       indented ("pretty-printed") version of the document.

       It uses Go's xml.MarshalIndent under the hood and supports basic
       control over prefix and indent strings. Basic masking support is
       planned (but not yet active in this version).

       When multiple files are given, xmlq prints each one separated by blank
       lines. When reading from stdin, xmlq attempts to detect raw XML content
       directly.

OPTIONS
       -prefix string
              Prefix string used before each element (default "")

       -indent string
              Indentation string used for nested elements
              (default "  " = two spaces)

       -v     Enable verbose output
              (shows filename headers even for single-file input)

       -version
              Print version number and exit

       -h, --help
              Show this help message (not implemented in code yet — use this page)

EXIT STATUS
       0      Success
       1      Error parsing XML, reading file(s), or writing output

EXAMPLES

   Pretty-print a single file
       xmlq config.xml

   Change indentation to tabs
       xmlq -indent $'\t' data.xml

   Two-space indent with custom prefix
       xmlq -prefix "  " -indent "    " response.xml

   Read from stdin (most common usage in pipelines)
       curl -s https://example.com/api | xmlq

   Multiple files with verbose headers
       xmlq -v file1.xml file2.xml file3.xml

   Use tabs and verbose mode
       xmlq -v -indent $'\t' *.xml

NOTES
   • Currently only pretty-printing is implemented.
   • Masking of sensitive values (e.g. PII, keys, tokens) is planned
     but not yet active (see commented Masks field in source).
   • CDATA sections are expected to be handled properly in future versions.
   • Input is read into temporary files when coming from stdin and appearing
     to contain XML tags.

BUGS / LIMITATIONS
   • No XPath / element selection / querying yet (name is xmlq, not xmlsel)
   • No support for --format=json or other output formats
   • Error recovery is basic — one bad file fails the whole run
